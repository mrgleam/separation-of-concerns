<!-- note
The proper technique is clearly to postpone the concerns for general acceptance until you have reached a result of such a quality that it deserves acceptance. It is the significance of your message that should justify the care that you give to its presentation, it may be its "unusualness" that makes extra care necessary. And, secondly, what is "general"? Has Albert Einstein failed because the Theory of Relativity is too difficult for the average highschool student?

# What is "general"?

#### "general acceptance"
